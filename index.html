          </h5>
          <p>Our Year 10 Junior Future Project classes, Junior Science Communicators and Junior Research Interns have
            kept busy during the lockdown. Taking part in a special “Depth Study” (ie science project) with our resident
            scientists from Quantal Bioscience, the boys were tasked with building a model on the timely topic: “How
            mRNA vaccines work”.

            Quantal Bioscience, who have been with The Future Project since its inception in 2014, is a research
            microbiology laboratory that studies microorganisms and how they affect all parts of life. Since last year,
            their team and our Future Project interns have been working with cutting-edge nanopore sequencing technology
            – the same technology currently being used to detect COVID-19 clusters around the world.

            Despite labs being closed, our boys have gone above and beyond, coming up with some incredible models using
            the resources they had at home. Their ingenuity has been remarkable and the level of science that they
            communicated is truly inspiring as they have surpassed the standard curriculum.

            “The boys have put a lot of effort into this project and what we have seen has been very impressive! We are
            so proud of these young men who have responded so well to take on this challenge,” said Dr Vera Munro-Smith,
            Director of The Future Project.

            “I am also thankful for the effort of the teachers involved (Ms Catherine Breene and Mr Bobby Gange) who
            helped guide the students through their projects,” she concludes.

            We look forward to Term 4 when our students can get back into the lab and put their knowledge into further
            practice.

          </h5>
          <p>Congratulations to Kevin Wang (’22) who has achieved first place in the state in both Chemistry and Mathematics Extension 2. 

            Earlier today the NSW Education Minister, Sarah Mitchell, hosted the First in Course Ceremony to honour students who ranked first in the state for the 2022 HSC courses. This is not the first time Kevin has attended the First in Course Ceremony. In 2021, as an accelerant student, Kevin placed first in course for Mathematics Advanced. 
            
            Kevin is known by the community as an exceptional young man, with an excellent mind. He has excelled academically and beyond, during his six years at The King’s School.
            
            Kevin is the 2022 recipient of The Reverend Canon Wallace Mort Prize for Dux of the School. He was also Year 11 Dux, and silver medallist at the International Chemistry Olympiad and a gold medallist at the Australian Chemistry Olympiad in 2022. 
            
            Furthermore, in recognition of his brilliant mind, at Graduation Kevin was awarded the GB Owen Tuck Prizefor Original Literary Composition, the DJ Thomas Prize for Physics, the Edward Britton Summerbell Prize for Chemistry, the UNSW Year 12 Student Mathematics Prize and academic prizes in Chemistry, English Extension 1 and Mathematics Extension 2.
            
            Kevin was a Year 12 Monitor in the Academic Portfolio, and he was an integral member of The Future Project, where he was able to pursue his passion for science and in particular, chemistry. 
            
            While Kevin is a gifted academic, he also contributed significantly to the co-curricular life at King’s. According to Kevin, it was the opportunity to try things outside the classroom which really pushed him to develop as a person. 
            
            “King’s helped me to recognise I could achieve greater fulfilment than academic success alone. It was through my co-curricular achievements that I was able to find self-confidence,” he says.
            
            Kevin was an integral member of the 1st Debating team, the Twelve Club and the Write Now Club. He also contributed to sports, playing Tennis, Table Tennis and was Captain of the 2nds Volleyball team. 
            
            “Through all the experiences I have had during my time at King’s, I have realised that I am both willing and capable of extending and enriching my path towards my final destination – and just how rewarding that can be.” 
            
            Kevin extended and enriched his pathway in many ways. As a member of the Cadet Corps, he was promoted to Cadet Under Officer (CUO) in recognition of his leadership skills. He also demonstrated resilience and endurance, gaining his Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award. This achievement is a true testament to his willingness to pursue opportunities outside the classroom. Kevin also contributed to the King’s Music program as a member of the clarinet ensemble and the Symphonic Band. 
            
            “My advice to the next class of HSC students is to make your last year at The King’s School count. Try whatever you want, leave with no regrets and do not take things too seriously.”
            
            Kevin hopes to become a medical doctor and is planning to study a Doctor of Medicine at UNSW or a Bachelor of Science and Postgraduate degree in Medicine at the University of Sydney.

        History Week: Cross Country Origins at King’s

          <p>Cross Country Origins at The King’s School
            With congratulations due particularly to the Senior Cross Country team of Oskar Bukovinsky (C), Jayden Gill, Oliver Lennox (VC), Ciaran Rushton, Gabe Scott and James Tierney, History Week provides us with the opportunity to delve into the background of this sport.
            
            While long distance running has been recorded on and off since 1886 the records show that the annual Five Mile Championship Cup was first competed for in 1918. The Cup, was the gift of Mrs Pring, the wife of RD Pring (MF 1866068, TKS 1986-70) Governor (1915-22) and the first recipient was GBD Hall. (TKS 1911-18). There was however no mention of the race itself in the School Magazine. The boys ran around Parramatta Park and across the railway line, before lapping the “Old King’s School” oval and Parramatta Cricket Ground and then entering back to School through the O’Connell St Gate.
            
            In 1975, under the watchful eye of former Old Boy, Commonwealth Games competitor and long-term staff member Berry Primrose, Cross Country became an alternative winter sport. Two years later the first inter-school event was held with St Ignatius College while Newington joined the event in 1980. The AAGPS agreed to trial the sport in 1985 and a series of events were run with the CAS schools. It was an immediate success with over 300 boys taking place each week.
            
            Keen for The King’s School boys to gain experience at a competitive level, Berry Primrose took a team to New Zealand in 1986 to compete in events in Auckland, Wanganui and Wellington. Here the team came 12th in a field of 100 teams from 24 different schools before the final race – the Hillview event in Christchurch. This overseas competition certainly developed the King’s team as in 1988 when Cross Country became an official GPS Sport the School won the first two premierships and were awarded the NA Emery Trophy. This trophy for Cross Country was donated by Shore to honour Neville Emery, a long time Shore staff member and AAGPS delegate and Convenor, and now trophies are awarded for Intermediate and Junior level competitions. The Prep School also have very large Cross Country competitions where you will find the junior school enthusiasts often coming to King’s to compete.
            
            The 2021 Cross Country competitors at all levels have shown themselves to be very worthy successors to those pioneers of the sport who with the ongoing support of dedicated staff, pounded the track back at the Old School Site
            
            History Fun Fact
            Did you know the last time we won this competition, our current Captain, Oscar Bukovinsky’s brother Jack was Captain? And in 1989, the Cross Country Captain was Andrew Lennox – the father of our current Cross Country Vice Captain, Oliver Lennox.
