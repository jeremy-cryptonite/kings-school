          <p class="text-muted">Boarding is the heart of The King’s School. Our boarders enjoy an unparalleled
            opportunity to live and learn on campus, develop their independence and resilience and form lifelong
            friendships.


            Boarding is very much a home away from home where the wonderfully supportive and highly qualified staff
            strive to make it a welcoming and safe space, and a rewarding learning adventure. Boys are encouraged to
            develop their individual talents and interests, taking full advantage of excellent facilities, inspiring
            surroundings and access to all the opportunities on offer.

            During their time at King’s, boarders will participate in an extensive range of learning programs,
            leadership experiences, sporting fixtures and excursions, developing their integrity, compassion, and a true
            sense of humility and place.</p>
